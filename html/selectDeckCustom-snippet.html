            <h3>Card Selection</h3>
            <p>
                Some cards are not good when playing aginst the Horde, either because they just don't do anything, or because they're too good. 
                If you have these cards or cards like them in your deck, I suggest replacing them with something else before you upload. 
                You can of course have your own custom rules to make them more or less effective if you prefer.

            <p>When pasting your deck, format your deck listing so that it has one unique card per line and looks like one of the following</p>
            <!--distinguish cards that start in other zones, e.g. commander-->
            <ul>
                <li>1 Storm Crow</li>
            </ul>
